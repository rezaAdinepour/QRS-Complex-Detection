# QRS Complex Detection in ECG signals
In this project, we detect the time domain parameters of the ECG signals, such as QRS complex, RR and QT intervals and T peaks.

## Dataset
I useed two simple datasets that you can find it <code>Dataset</code> here.

You can use any other datasets. **You only need to note that the recorded signal is saved in a <code>.txt</code> file**

## How to work?
After you clone this repository
